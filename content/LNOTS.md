Is it fair to say I'm desocialized? Or is it more fair to say I have lots of people who enjoy my company and would call me social & socialized? The inner experience is then for me this pendulum between thinking about things probalistically or being emotionally driven. 

Can I assume this experience is not a terrible process as long as one's not aware of it? In this case awareness does not necesarily result in course-correction towards one or the other.

While there may be attempts to course correct, it is also not unlikely that there will be a decoupling wherein both the rational and emotional side of the selves struggle with becoming aware of one's own existence. 

Awareness of the self is the feedback loop that keeps on giving.
