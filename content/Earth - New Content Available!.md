New content has been made available for the classic RPG and world simulator, EARTH.

The creators of Earth, Nick and Celine, announced today they moved up the release of EARTH 2050-2100 to fill the scenario gap now that Humanity has achieved critical mass, discovered compound-level time travel almost 30 years before schedule, and set the stage for global environmental disaster almost 200,000 years before predicted. Good job denizens - We're looking at you humans!



Look out for these new events and scenarios:
- Alien life - does it exist? Yes! It was around you the whole time!
- Look out for 2024, when we're hiding a little piece of technology that will enable humanity to communicate with their own subconscious! Uh oh, is the hologram about to come crashing down?
- God? Yes you can!
