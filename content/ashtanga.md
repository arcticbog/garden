title: "Ashtanga"

Ashtanga has been fun. I found my way to it last summer, with a youtube video while I was inside on a rainy day.

That trip had already been a freeing force, having felt pulled by this pressure and that pressure for the prior few years. Practicing yoga while living in integrity with myself was a straight up pleasuresful practice. Nowadays, I find that doing a few sun salutations brings me back to that integral state. Sometimes only for the duration of the practice. Sometimes for the day.

The sun salutations are remarkable movements. It took me a while to fully appreciate the cautionary messaging of instructors ("don't push it, go only to where feels comfortable") as invitations to just explore the process of the body, making tweaks here and there, and not as challenges to overcome.
