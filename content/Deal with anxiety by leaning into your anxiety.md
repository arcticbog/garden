A neccesary aspect of growth is learning to sit with emotions, and giving them the space to be felt properly. 

Of course, [We have many selves. That's okay. Just pay attention.](We%20have%20many%20selves.%20That's%20okay.%20Just%20pay%20attention..md).]  Pay attention. Don't avoid it. 

Pain and discomforts are a necccesary part of life, and to drive them away or to chase pleasures to fill each occurance of pain will result in, as per Pete Walker in Complex PTSD, either a complete overwhelment of the feeling trying to be avoided, or a complete numbing of the "emotional continuum"

And remember, thoughts are just thoughts. Feelings are just feelings. I am more than my thoughts and feelings.
