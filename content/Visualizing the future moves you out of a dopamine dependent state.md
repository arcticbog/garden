title: "Visualizing the future moves you out of a dopamine dependent state"
---
We rarely think of the future, because we are constantly wrapped in the now. By placing more emphasis on the now, we become dopamine-dependent. Since dopamine especially fires when there is a sign of imminent reward, it does not fire for future based outcomes. 

As such, we can and should make future us more concrete - it allows us to slow down and leave the minute-to-minute dopamine craving brain. The best way to do that is simply envision yourself doing something in the future. Even something as simple as grocery shopping in a week can help ground us.

In fact, even visualizing something within a few minutes can help curb the dopamine craving state. For example, dopamine does not fire for junk food if you tell yourself you will have some in 10 minutes. The immediate possibility reward is important for dopamine to fire.
