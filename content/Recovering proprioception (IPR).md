# Recovering proprioception: why & how

There's a certain amount of filtering that blocks what makes it to the the foreground of our thinking. An active thought that is willed into existence is very different from the ocassional and often surfacing of our weird and whacky minds.

Likewise, paralocal stimulus/external input stimulus has gets filtered - we need not be aware of the state of our legs at every moment of our walk.

As it turns out, it's actually quite nice to occasionally feel the state of our legs. I love a good dance as much as the next one (preferably by myself though tbh).
