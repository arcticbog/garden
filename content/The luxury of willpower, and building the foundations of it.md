title: "The luxury of willpower, and building the foundations of it"
---

The idea of willpower is pretty inane, when you think about it. Some chemical process going about inside you is deciding whether you will or will not do things that you want to do. Seriously - a chemical imbalance that makes it so you don't do what you want to do? Thanks brain. 

There's seemingly a clear divide between those with willpower, and those without. Hard workers, and lazy people - their make up determined by the right ingredients of nature and nurture.

Nurture is key. The environment we grow up in becomes a prototypical environment and the way we navigate the rest of the world. If our template is out of whack, then there will always be discordance in trying to apply the template to the real. 

Similarly, the tools we're given during our initial nurturing periods are what allow for a smooth propagation of skills that are neccesary for life. Like how you can't expect a child to do a backflip before first crawling (atleast a meter or so), you can't expect the child, teen, or adult who's foundational understanding of something as critical as *trust* is incomplete. 

The critical factors in developing a sense of dilligence and doing are vast, which is why I am a fan of dev psychologist D.W. Winnicott's idea of "good-enough parenting". 100% optimal conditions do not exist (and I believe that perfect conditions lead to sub-optimal results). Likewise, good enough framework building can be enough to create the functioning adult that is "good enough" in managing their day to day life - juggling responsibilities, a social life, a love life, and their exploration of their own self. 

Chances are, you are not perfect at any of those things. Chances are, though, you are good enough. But still, ideally we could harness our desire to be better effectively. Ideally, we could tell ourselves "I want to be more healthy" and do it - good enough.

It is the bringing of this concept of good enough outside of the core tenets of behaviour that can be difficult, and where willpower comes in. We may be good enough at socializing, but we may wish we had a bigger friend group, or closer friends. Our wishes are in essence "I am good enough at X, but I wish I was also good enough at this subset of X." 

## The Willpower Instinct
Kelly McGonigal has written a fairly comprehensive text on Willpower. I typically shy away from these NYT best seller books because they almost always are 20 pages of useful knowledge, and 280 pages of filler.
