title: "The Licensing and Halo effect"
---
The licensing effect refers to our propensity to allow ourselves to 'sin' after first doing something 'good.' 

For example, we may decide to go for salad instead of burger when we're watching our diets. As a result of that, we license ourselves to get a big desert. 

Similarly, The Halo Effect refers to entering a "Halo" where negative sentiment is dampened because of another virtous aspect. For example, eating a bag of potato chips seems more fine when it is covered by the Halo of "Gluten Free"
