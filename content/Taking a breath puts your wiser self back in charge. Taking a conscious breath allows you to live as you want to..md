title: "Taking a breath puts your wiser self back in charge. Taking a conscious breath allows you to live as you want to."

If you're grappling with an issue, or about to do something you know you'd like not to - and are in a mindset that is hard to exit (i.e. binging on food or about to smoke) - ask your "wiser self": What do you want?

The wiser self probably has a good answer. And even just asking is enough to make you hesitate, and consider a better way forward

To put your wiser self back in control, take a minute and slow your breath. This exits a fast mode, and enters a 'longterm survival' slow mode
