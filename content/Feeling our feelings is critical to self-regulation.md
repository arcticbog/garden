title: "Feeling our feelings"
---

Trying to supress what we are thinking leads to a concept called Ironic Rebound (wherein the thing you are trying to push away comes back with more intensity). Instead, the best thing is to examine and feel the feeling. 

It's especially important to remember that feelings are not the truth, and we can allow the feeling to occur without it affecting who we are and how we act. 

The concept of riding the urges, and feeling them through the entirety of their being there can be very powerful - and eventually all feelings subside. If they are overly strong, consider focusing on the breath too.
