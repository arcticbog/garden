Heart rate variability is an indicator of stress.

Basically, your heart places greater emphasis on beating consistently when it is under duress. Hence, the variability of the time between heart beat drops and it it beats more consistently.

When it is not under duress and not stressed, variability increases, as the heart no longer has a reason to be consistent. There is greater variation in the time between heart beats.
