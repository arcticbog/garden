I meditated for too long but didn't stop to think about what would happen when I came to blieve that reality is entirely internal.

And if it's all internal.

Then reality is malleable.

If it's malleable, then there's no certainity of anything.

With no certainity of anything, you could be in bliss 24/7, but more likely you're floating through space fighting off anxiety attacks.

Anyway, that was a funny time for interacting with the world. I studied more and clawed my way onto the stable ground I could find. Which unfortunately/fortunately were things like Holographic universe theory, Itzhak Bentov, the Sutras, and some other fun stuff. 

Eventually I just realized that if reality is malleable by me, then I am God. And if I am God, you can too. 

And then you realize that if everyone can be God, then anything can be God. Then you realize "oh, made in '''''his'''''' image makes sense."

Then you notice that the crack in the pavement look like lightning strikes or a river system. Then you look at pictures of deepspace and pictures of cranial activity and pictures of cellular activity and you start to think "[[Wait a second, what's going on here]]"

**All that to say, I blame Dan Harris for telling me meditation would make me happier**
