title: "Bogdan"
---

A Cyrillic name (I think?) that way back the etymological line, came from the same place as Jonathan. BogDan, JonaThan. Adds up. 

They both mean God's gift. I used to shrug and laugh at that - I had my suspicions about God's existence at age 6 when I was told Jesus would show up at midnight mass and then later told "oh, he couldn't make it" before being told "but he can see us right now."

Nowadays, having gone through a [[Spiritual journey the likes very many have seen]], I am more of a believer of God, in the sense that it's [[Turtles all the way down]], God is in every atom, and I listen to JEWELZ by Anderson .Paak and think about Indra's JEWLEZ. Jules? Juuls? Verne?
