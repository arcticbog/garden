Source : [[The Willpower Instinct]]

The things that control us, the decisions that we make, everything that our mind wrangles - it can all be categorized as an I Will, an I Want, or an I Won't

*I will* clean the car
*I want* to succeed
*I won't* smoke cigarettes anymore.

Mastering willpower means mastering the I wills, I wants, and I wonts of your life.
