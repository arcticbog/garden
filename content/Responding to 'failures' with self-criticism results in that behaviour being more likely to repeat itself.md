title: "Responding to 'failures' with self-criticism results in that behaviour being more likely to repeat itself"

Self compassion is important, as it is a way to lower your HRV ([[HRV is your willpower fuel tank]]). It is also important because forgiving yourself for 'transgressing' is far more effective in curtailing future transgressions than criticism and self-hate.
In [[The Willpower Instinct]], Kelly McGonigal makes reference to how people who beat themselves up over drinking too much one night, are far more likely to drink too much the next night as well. 

In essence, critique actually makes it far more likely you will repeat the behaviour. So, love yourself and forgive yourself!
