title: "superstore"

There is a shortage of everything, I've been told. I'm not doubting it, I've noticed that sometimes my chip flavour of choice is out of stock.

It is great to live in a place where you can buy your meats and eggs and flours and cheeses and syrups and so forth - locally. it's not super accessible and it's definitely pricey. but resiliency! the dream!  but not always easily in reach when the inflation rate is the highest it's been in decades.

on the other hand. superstore. the default choice. the solidly neutral place of obtaining all your groceries. reminds the southerners of back home.

I noticed superstore has been having more sales. more things have been on sale. less things on the shelves. more things on sale. but the sales are almost always **buy 2 for $x**. the sales push for emptying the shelves! 

(wow well done bog, sales make products move, good job you're hired) (yes but when the shelves are already looking sparse and people are finding they can't get a can of tomatoes cause the sale annihilated the stocks of all canned tomatoes, then they get no canned tomatoes welcome to the end of the sentence.)

a little less things on the shelf?

unless you get stock allocated to your store when you clear stock. sell more, restock more. strains the supply chain in a funny way. but certainly makes the shareholders happy. customers get more stock more often. until something doesn't work?
