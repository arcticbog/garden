I say DBT but I really mean some hybrid of all the current cog-sci methods and doodads of staying mindful/mentally fit.

I especially mention DBT because I think it's become too common to misunderstand how the brain work - by which I mean it's too common to come unto the understanding that we have any clue of how the brain works.

In other words, you either know you don't know, or you don't know you don't know, and the worst thing you can do is not know, and pretend to know.

Anyway, my ego has decided that it is unbearable that an abysmally small sets of people could do with some wizening up, and I've carried decided that if those folks could have some self-doubt and self-reflection forced upon them, it would be better for all of us. 

(the sets are people comment on things on the internet).

Why can't we accept that absolute truth doesn't exist? Why can't we accept that all we have are approximations? 

DBT is about acknowledging that all we have are approximations and oh boy if we try to turn approximations into rules. In other words

**If you're going to start with an opinion and work backwards to find proof, then you better also take the time to start with proof atleast half of the time**


## On DBT

"Through her work, Linehan realized the importance of two concepts in mental health. One of these was that to achieve meaningful and happy lives, people must learn to accept things as they are. The other was that change is necessary for growth and happiness." [Marsha Linehan, DBT's creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_M._Linehan)



DBT is about simulatenously holding multiple truths, and thinking "oh nice" and not "this is difficult and incompatible with my current operating system and it hurts." That's why DBT is the most effective way of overcoming Borderline personality disorder: you're upgrading the OS to entertain the possibility of truth in flow.
