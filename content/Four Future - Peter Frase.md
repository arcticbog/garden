# overly-long Summary & thoughts on Four Futures 
Title: Four Futures 
Author: Peter Frase

Summary:
Peter Frase recognizes that we today’s icnreasingly divise world does have a breaking point, and we can move into one of 4 futures, based on scarcity of resources, and social order. 

## Rentism
_**Abundance of resources, Hierarchical social structure**_
Though we can call [[capitalist]] society existing as a result of scarce resources which need to be distributed in some way, wage labour also serves as a powerful system for control - “Having power over others is, for many powerful people, its own reward. Thus, they will endeavour to maintain a system where others serve them, even if such a system is, from a purely productive standpoint, totally superfluous”(70)
	
We may think of rentism as it relates to Landlords & those who pay to live on property owned by them, rentism can & does refer to any thing which someone is charged to access. So - land, yes - but also copyrights and patents. In this chapter, Frase talked a lot about Star Trek (he mentions it throughout the book tbh), and how that universe exists in a post scarcity, egalitarian world. The key object is the replicator, which can create things on demand.

If such a device was to exist in todays world, the seat of power would be the entity which held the copyright to items to be replicated- "Those who control the most copyrights and patents become the new ruling class"

In classical rentism, the value of land was not from the crops or factory or people on it, but simply value in the land "as a gift of nature". and so whoever claimed ownership can demand payment for controlling access to property, even if they do naught with it (72)

rentiers create nothing, making nothing do nothing: they just passively accept the rewards of ownership (73)

in 1879 book, progress and poverty, henry george says the true remedy to income inequality was to make land common property

the right to intellectual property is a right to a pattern. Property right = sell you something, but you do whatever you want with it. Intellectual right = sell you something, use it in the exact way i tell you to do (77) (see iphone jailbreak legality, bowman vs monsanto)

the global 1% percent- alot of their value is backed by immaterial,intelectual forms of property (79)

### The kinds of people under rentism (jobs) (83)
- Creative class for coming up with new things to copyright
- Lawyers, since the economy is based on intellectual property where companies will be suing each other for alleged infringements (84)
- Since things to buy will grow but wages will not, there will be firece competition, and so lots of advertising and marketing 
- And then, as with any society "predicated on maintaing great inequalities of wealth and power even when they have become economically superflous witll require a large amount of labor to prevent hte poor and powerless from taking a share back from the rich and powerful" - Guard labour (samuel bowles, arjun jayadev)
## Communism
_**Abundance of resources & Equality**_
Communism is seen as the laissez fair social rights equivalent. Frase makes a lot of callbacks to Star Trek, which is painted as an egalitarian post-scarcity world.
	
In Capital, Marx distinguinshes between the realm of necessity & the realm of freedom: The realm of necessity is the underpinning of life - the 'wrestle with Nature to satisfy wants, to maintain and reproduce life'. The realm of necessity exists underneath all forms of life. The realm of freedom is achieved when that first realm is conquered - when the "production is rationally planed and democratically organized"(39) The hope, then, is to move past the realm of necessity 

John Maynard Kenyes :"Man will be faced with his real permanent problem - how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares...which science and compound interest will have won from him"

"The shift from being unemployed to being retired brings about immediate and dramatic increases in happiness" - unenmployement carries a powerful social stigma. The unemployed no longer have to worry about meeting the social norm of being employed (45)

The way to move forward is with automation, but there is hostility to automation because of worry about how people will be left behind - Moving forward without leaving people behind

"We should not assume that the end of capitalism involves some grand revolutionary movement that bides its time and builds strenght" (50) - "since we are a long way from being able to force such a reckoning...we can in the meantime build the alternative to capitalisj before it is completely overturned" -  Through UBI - "the effect of the welfare state, at its most universal and generous, is to decommodify labor"

Programs like enomplyement protection, socialized medicine, retirement income, and guaranteed elligibility for these programs - means that labor is partially decomodified

Reformist reforms and non-reformist reforms. A non-reformist reform is determined based on what it should be, not what it can be - UBI

UBI would push up wage rate ofor unattractive work (that people take now just to be able to survive), and bring down the rate for attractive, rewarding work (Since people are already fundamentally covered, they can accept a high quality jar below the gauranteed income level) (56)

If you take this idea and stretch it forward, you reach a point where all wage labour is eliminated. Undesirable work is automated, since meployers no longer want to deal with hirng people for too expensive. "The things holding back full automation isnt that the techniology isnt there, its that cheaped to hire humans"

A drop in GDP would be fine because it also means a drop in the cost of living. ALl needs are already met and covered. 

Of course, not all things (ie suffering) can attributed to capital, but it is such a fundeamental concept that it is impossible to seperate capital from them - like a "social magnet, with capital at one end and labor at the other, that tends to align all other social hierarchies with the master hierachy based on money"

A postscarcity society is not one free of hierarchy, but it ius one where there are various amounts of hierarchie - but none which is superior to the other (6*)


	
## Socialism
_**Scarcity & Equality**_
	A ravaged world means that scarcity guides every move. In socialism, we arrive at a point in time where our planet has been trashed by human practices, and we move forward with better methods of energy usage and production, as well as ways to reverse our impact.
Debating whether climate change is real is just a farce at this point- those who deny it don't actually reject it, they just don't care about it. They believe they are sufficiently removed in their ivory tower and can and will escape the worst case scenario)

Environmental impact is now too late in the game to simply ceases doing the bad stuff. Carbon capturing is an example of methods that can be used to even undo our impact on earth’s ecosystems.
It’s important to note that the fatalism, or the constant “oh no, we’re doomed” has been around for a long time, and probably will be along for a lot longer of a time - and Frase mentions that while the leftist doom & gloomers revel in their being right about things being shitty, those in power still receive their deserts. (103)
The environment was already always changing, so to try to hit pause in one current state of being is very human thing to do. Even once we are gone, the ecosystems will survive and keep on changing. Socialism would involve living in this evolving world, and nourishing it accordingly so that it nourishes us.
Regulation of resources is an important concept in a scarce world. 
An important part is that technology and environmentalism are now linked very thoroughly - Frase  mentions french sociologist bruno latour, who makes an observation saying the real sin of frankenstein was not making his creature, but it was abandoning and not caring for it. Likewise, "when the technologies that we have created end up having unforeseen and terrifying consequences - global warming, polluitin, extinction - we recoil in horror from them. Yet we canotm nor should we, abandon nature now. We have no choice but to become ever more involved in a consciously changing nature. WE have no choice but to love the mosnter we have made, lest it turn on us and destroy us. (105)"





## Exterminism
**_Scarcity & Hierarchy_**
Exterminism occurs when we reach a point where there is an excess of the working class, or the prols, or the poor - the rabble, essentially - and the ruling class has no need for them - i.e, the labour potential of these people is meaningless to them.

The rich, in this world, live in a world where for them, everything is essentially free (because their wealth is so great compared to the CoL)- they essentially live in communism.

The exterminism chapter asks "what if resources and energy are simply too scarce to allow everyone to enjoy the material standard of living that the rich enjoy today?"

"Part of the hope in a revolution is the interdepence between capital and labour - "the victory of the workers i inevitable because they have taken untold millions that they have never toiled to earn, but without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn' With the rise of the robots, the second line ceases to hold." (123) Solidarity Forever

Since there is a huge danger to the existence of an impoverished class to a ruling class, there are a number of ways the ruling class can deal with them (123)
-they can be bought off with some degree of resource distribution (welfare)
	(however, this can introduce some scarcity to the ruling class but more importantly, 'this solution is liable to lead to an ever-rising tide of demands on the part of the masses' 124) -
"but what happens once hte masses are  dangerous but are no longer a working class, and hence of no value to the rules? Someone will eventually get the idea that it would be better to get rid of them" 124

Which Sci-fi nightmare world are we heading into? A Not Really Review of Four Futures, Life after Capitalism by Peter Frase

No Commentson Which Sci-fi nightmare world are we heading into? A Not Really Review of Four Futures, Life after Capitalism by Peter Frase
I haven’t written any sort of book review or summary or critiques in a long time, so these are mostly some thoughts and summarizations of the book.

Four Futures is a ~150ish page book that takes a look at how our world could look like post-current nightmare of capitalism. Peter Frase specifically divides some possibilities into one of four:


Frase uses a lot of examples from science fiction, name dropping a novel or tv show or what not, making me feel at-first exceptionally unread, and then later pumping into me some desire to read more science fiction (my last serious foray into scifi was reading all the halo books when I was 13), which I will do so beginning with Kim Stanley Robinson’s Three California’s Trilogy – three novels looking at a post-something world. Post Nuke? Post scarcity? There’s three of em and I don’t really know.

So we got communism: i.e. everyone’s got enough to survive and money and capital and labour and yada yada yada no longer have anything to do with human relations. Instead, it’s just a big ol popularity contest and the person with the biggest Instagram following is the monarch

Then we have rentism aka basically what’s happening right now. We all have enough, but we have to pay out 10.99 a month for the privilege.We pay our landlord for the right to occupy a space, we pay Spotify to rent some music, we pay Microsoft to show us ads in Windows, Netflix, Tiktok Elite, Uber Black, Zingo Zango Plus, etc etc etc and we commit 30% of our income to some intangible (literally as in you cannot hold it) products & services. This is what drives silicon valley

Socialism explores the world after everyone pooped on it. Everythings scarce but we’re all in it together, piecing together remnants of a terribly run civilization (our current one.)

And then Donald’s wet dream, exterminism, where the powerful no longer have need of the rabble so they are shooed to some corner of the world and/or there is a hole dug to the core of the earth and those dirty poors are pushed in. It’s the stage where the rich have no use for the proletariat, but know they’re still plenty capable of ruining their lives.

Communism
An abundance of resources, and a whole whack of equality. Or at least, that’s how Frase sorts this ideology. Having spent a lot of time on the internet though, I can confidently say that communism can not be succinctly defined or described without a minimum of 8000 words. Or maybe it can (something something from each according to his ability, to each according to his need)

In this future, humanity has stepped past scarcity, and entered Marx’s realm of freedom (Frase makes mention of Marx’s realm of necessity v.s. realm of freedom, where the realm of necessity is the underpinning of life – ‘the wrestle with nature to satisfy wants, to maintain and reproduce life.’ Marx stipulates that the realm of freedom can only be achieved when the realm of necessity is conquered.)

So we live in a word where everyone’s needs are met, and people are equal. Psych! No such thing as equality. Instead, the world is one where the Capital-Labour relation has been removed and people can just loaft around doing whatever they want.

Most economists of the older ages thought this was the logical progression of humanity: we all reach a point where we no longer need to work, and we can do whatever we want:

Man will be faced with his real permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares (…) which science and compound interest have won for him.

– John Keynes
Obviously, we have not reached this state yet. Well, some people have – but for the majority, the end of capitalism seems a far far distant future. Instead, to reach this future, the foundation is laid down now through social programs. Programs like socialized healthcare, employment insurance, any sort of welfare – their net effect, when they are done well, universally, and without asterisks, is that they decommodify labor.

Universal Basic Income is touted as the solution – unattractive work has to increase its wage and attractive/rewarding work is brought down in wage. Moving this idea forward, since companies really are just about money money money, there would come a point where wage labour is just eliminated due to automation. What’s holding back employers from going full throttle on automation now?

It’s cheaper to hire people! A lot cheaper! Why is it cheaper? Because that’s the capital/wage labour system we’re forced into! Wowsers!

There is a caution – not all suffering, not all bad things can be attributed to capital. But due to its omnipresence, it is felt in all aspects of life – like a “social magnet, with capital at one end and labor at the other, that tends to align all other social hierarchies with the master hierarchy based on money.”

Frase instead stumbles through some post scarcity futures in scifi which are based on social clout, and so hierarchy is based on the value you bring to whatever niche or domain. Sort of like now, but the end goal is not capital.

Essentially, a post-scarce, post-capital society is not truly one free of hierarchy, it’s one where there are various amounts of hierarchies – and none superior to the other (you know, ideally.)

Rentism
In theory, capitalism’s altruistic purpose is to make good distribution of resources in a society of scarcity. In function, wage labour is also gnarly for people who are power hungry.

“Have power over others is, for many powerful people, its own reward. Thus they will endeavour to maintain a system where others serve them, even if such a system is, from a purely productive standpoint, totally superfluous.”

So humanity arrives to a post-scarcity world – basically, we’re not really worrying about our needs anymore. So how does the ruling class do its ruling? That’s right, itsssss ReNtIsM.

We may think of rentism specifically as it relates to Landlords & those who pay to live on property owned by them, but really: rentism can & does refer to any thing which someone is charged to access. So – land, yes – but also copyrights and patents and intangible things.

In this chapter, Frase talked a lot about Star Trek (he mentions it throughout the book tbh), and how that universe exists in a post scarcity, egalitarian world: The key object is the replicator, which can create things on demand. I’ve never watched Star Trek, but it sounds neat.

Can’t believe I’m still writing this I am getting real bored but I’ve committed and must trudge on.

If such a device was to exist in todays world, the seat of power would be the entity which held the copyright to items to be replicated- “Those who control the most copyrights and patents become the new ruling class.”

In classical rentism, the value of land was not from the crops or factory or people on it, but simple the land as a “gift of nature”. and so whoever claimed ownership can demand payment for controlling access to property, even if they don’t actually do anything with it. As we all know, rentiers “create nothing, making nothing, do nothing: they passively accept the rewards of ownership.”

Okay etc etc, so now we live in a world where we all have enough, but the ruling class needs to flex – and they do this by owning the rights to how we use and consume intangible things. Okay, what does that mean?

Property right: Someone can sell you a coffee
Intellectual right: Someone can sell you something AND tell you exactly how you must drink it. Imagine going to a McDonald’s and you bought a McDouble & a Jr. Chicken and combined the two and you were about to bite down into your divine creation when all of a sudden-

Ronald himself appears with a crowbar, and starts breaking your head in because you’ve violated the copyright of the McDonald products. That’s intellectual copyright – the right to a pattern, and how its used.

So we’re moving towards that world. Frase says that the global 1%’s value is actually backed by exactly these rights. “Immaterial, intellectual forms of property.” So what does the day to day look like in these conditions. Well, there’s really only a handful of jobs (and pay attention to how close this mirrors today society, versus a decade or two decades ago):

The creative class which comes up with new things to copyright
Lawyers to sue other companies and any other infringers who are not eating burgers the right way.
Marketers: Since things to buy will grow but wages will not, there will be fierce competition to sell products
And then, as with any society “predicated on maintaining great inequalities of wealth and power even when they have become economically superfluous will require a large amount of labor to prevent the poor and powerless from taking a share back from the rich and powerful” – and this is called Guard Labour…or you know, the police. The army. Actually, I wonder if Lawyers could fall into this too.
The way I see it, our current path is closest to this future. Or at least, it is for me who is not yet critically endangered by COVID-19. Only time will tell how much my privilege will slink away. For a lot of the world, the reality of Exterminism seems more familiar.

Exterminism
Man with money needed poor man to make make money in the past. Now too many poor man, no need. Disposable. Poor man need go.

Excuse the caveman speak. The way the book paints exterminism is a bit chilling, if only because of its familiarity. Earlier in the Communism chapter, Frase mentions that for the rich, they basically already live in a communist world. When your wealth is so flagrant that buying something like a new laptop or a new car or a new house are the equivalent of a poor person buying gum or a coffee, you live in a world where you have everything you could ever need. You live in communism – it’s just, ya know, not communal.

Okay, so in the future where scarcity means that the ruling class can’t just go sharesies on all their wealth because it would impact their lifestyles, the rich need to make sure the prols can be contained. How?

Sure, you could redistribute some wealth and sprinkle a few social program – but “this solution is liable to lead to an ever-rising tide of demands on the part of the masses.” See, the idea of a re-equalization of the impoverished class hangs on the thread of connection between capital and labour. It hangs on the idea of Solidarity Forever. With the severance of labour from capital, and as such the loss of value of the worker to the rich, “someone will eventually get the idea that it would be better to get rid of them.”

Where do we see that now? Well, all around. The unemployed and the sick and those taking refuge. Those who are not needed for the current production cycle are relegated to die – not just in the third world, but in the backyards of our very cool very shiny western countries. I have no doubt in my head that COVID has planted a seed of ideas into many a conservative leader. After all, you don’t have to pay a pension out to someone who’s dead.

Remind me to write a post on how “””””””Fake News”””””” that glorifies anti-vaxing or anti-masking or anti ??? and is intended for the conspiracy theorist is probably concocted in some Langley building that wants these folks to go away….at first glance, it’s not a terrible idea. But hating the deep Appalachian redneck for being anti-refuge is tantamount to hating poor people for not having read political theory. Things are complicated, and people like simple answers. A lot easier for destitute folk to idolize cheeto man and hate muslims, then it is for them to sit down and read Capital. Sorry, that wasn’t part of the book….

Uhhhh moving on.

Socialism
Things were shitty, things continue to be shitty, and now we’re dealing with it – together!

Scarcity looms and humanity has gone through yet another catastrophic shift. And when I say humanity, I mean America itself has to experience what every country its ever invaded has had to face. Neat?!

In Frase’s universe, this future is a ravaged world where scarcity guides every move. We’ve arrived at a point in time where our planet has been trashed (by us), and we move forward with better methods, or at least better attempts, of energy usage and production. Examples of sci-fi where bands of post apocalyptic survivors roam and scavenge and farm and fish actually paint a somewhat serene picture. Aside from the looming elephant that asks “how did it get to this.”

We are at a point in time where it’s too late in the game of environmental impact to just stop doing actions which harm our planet. To deal with climate degradation, methods which undo impacts must be the primary methods. Sorry – I’m talking about now.

This all being said, “the environment” was already always changing, so to try to hit pause on something that has never been static is a very human thing to do. The natural world goes through starvation and death and scarcity and renewal. It’s done so before us, and even once we are gone, the ecosystems will survive and keep on changing.

Instead, socialism would involve living in this evolving world, and nourishing it accordingly so that it nourishes us.

An important part is that technology and environmentalism are now linked very thoroughly – Frase makes mention of French sociologist Bruno Latour, who opined that the real sin of Frankenstein was not making his creature, but abandoning and not caring for it.

Likewise, “when the technologies that we have created end up having unforeseen and terrifying consequences – global warming, pollution, extinction – we recoil in horror from them. Yet we can not, nor should we, abandon nature now. We have no choice but to become ever more involved in a consciously changing nature. We have no choice but to love the monster we have made, lest it turn on us and destroy us.”

This is an especially important note to make because of the tendency of gloom by those fighting the good fight. Fatalism, or the constant “oh no, we’re doomed” has been around for a long time, and probably will be along for a lot longer of a time – and Frase mentions that while the leftist doom & gloomers revel in their being right about things being shitty, those in power still receive their deserts.

A word or two
A prediction of where our world is heading will always be something new. 2020 has tossed a wrench into any prediction model – the boiling point of marginalized communities has been reached, a pandemic has revealed that the majority of us are the fodder for creating wealth. How will those in power consolidate a future they can live in, with the future the rest of us will live in? Will we be tossed aside and left for rats or fire and brimstone – as in exterminism? Or is there actually some sort of vague hope that things will be better, that we can function as a people with humane characteristics?

I don’t have much hope for good days, but I do have hope in humanity eventually banding together to face down threats to our existence. As it is, that threat is just humanity staring right back at us.
