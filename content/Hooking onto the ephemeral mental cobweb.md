Spaced repetition ranks above reading a line 250 times in a row till you remember it. Read about something one day, test yourself the next day. The dance between input and process is great when it happen within a few days. I remember the idea being obvious when I learned it in [Learning how to learn] https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn.

You can strengthen a memory or an idea or a thought by recalling it. You can also associate it with something multi-sensory. Remembering a flower by its scent and its setting. 

Funnily though, this points to a weird truth about the way our knowledge works. we're entirely networked based creatures - in our social lives, and in our brain waves. The way our brains remember things is by extending enough struts out until something sticks. Those struts are our senses and recollections and feelings and so forth about any memory. the more struts, the more lodged in there it is.Â 

Furthermore, each link those struts have is a potential starting or joining point for remembering. You could say that every memory you have is linked to more memories, and it's that long line of stickiness that makes it all... stick. We really just are wikipedia, links all over the place.
